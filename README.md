# ![power](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a926c297-4877-4fcf-93bc-f28d10fc4b46) Getting Started

### 1. Install Python  
Django requires Python to run.

1. Download Python from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it.
2. During installation, check the option to **Add Python to PATH**.
3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

### 2. Verify or Install pip (Python Package Manager)

`pip` is the package manager for Python, typically included with Python 3.4+.

- Check if pip is installed:
  ```bash
  pip --version
  ```
- If pip is not installed, run:
  ```bash
  python -m ensurepip --upgrade
  ```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Virtual environments help isolate dependencies for your project.

- Create a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python -m venv env
  ```
- Activate the virtual environment:
  - **Windows**:
    ```bash
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - **macOS/Linux**:
    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

### 4. Install Django

Install Django using pip:
```bash
pip install django
```

### 5. Verify Django Installation

Check the Django version to confirm installation:
```bash
django-admin --version
```

- Navigate to the main project directory:
   ```bash
   cd mainpage
   ```
   
- Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
- Open your browser and visit: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).
